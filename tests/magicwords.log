#
# How they're supposed to work:
#
# 1. The word "fum", from the famous phrase, "fee fie foe fum" is treated
# as a red herring for the player and is handled differently in the
# logic of the game
#
# 2. Each word of the magic phrase and the word "fum" can be preceded by
# the word "say", so "say fee", "say fie", etc. will work, as
# well. For "say fum", 'Okay, "FUM"' should NOT be the response,
# similar to what is seen when other non-magic words are uttered with
# "say"
#
# 3. The sequence is triggered by the first word "fee" only. If any of
# the other words of the phrase or "fum" are said before "fee",
# "nothing happens"
#
# 4. The phrase "fee fie foe foo" must be entered as four separate
# commands, in order, without interruption. A move, like "east" or a
# non-move, like "look", are both considered interruptions
#
# 5.  Once the sequence has begun, if any of the words of the phrase,
# including a second "fee", are said out of order, or "fum" is spoken at
# all during the sequence, the player is admonished for not being able
# to read. The assumption here is the player at some point in the time
# had previously read the phrase, but then messes up the order and/or
# thinks "fum" was a part of the phrase when they attempt to speak
# it. The player then must say "fee" again to restart the sequence. And
# to clarify, a second "fee" in the sequence triggers the admonishment,
# it does not restart the sequence

/*
 * Implement rand(3), the standard C PRNG API, using the non-standard but
 * higher quality random(3) implementation and the same size 128-byte state
 * LFSR as the random(3) default.
 *
 * It turns out there are portable applications that want a PRNG but are too
 * lazy to use better-but-nonstandard interfaces like random(3), when
 * available, and too lazy to import higher-quality and faster PRNGs into their
 * codebase (such as any of SFC, JSF, 128-bit LCGs, PCG, or Splitmix64).
 *
 * Since we're stuck with rand(3) due to the C standard, we can at least have
 * it produce a relatively good PRNG sequence using our existing random(3)
 * LFSR.  The random(3) design is not particularly fast nor compact, but it has
 * the advantage of being the one already in the tree.
